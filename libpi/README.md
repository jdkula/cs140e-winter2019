Initial TODO: 
	- copy your gpio and uart code here, and remove ours from the makefile.
	- make sure that lab6-emulation/hello works.

The idea:
	- When you make a useful file in a lab, put it here so you can 
	easily use in other labs.

	-  Don't change our header files, since those are the common interfaces.

	- Modify the makefile to use your new files and/or replace our
	versions (which are always prefixed with "cs140e-").

	- includes.mk defines some helpful makefile macros if you want to 
	include them in your various lab makefiles.

If you get a conflict and want to discard your local changes:
 git checkout -- <file>
